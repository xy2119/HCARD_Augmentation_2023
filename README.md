# HCARD_Augmentation_2023
Welcome to the HCARD Augmentation 2023 repository! This repository contains the source code for an AI-driven motion tracking drawing application created as part of the Human Centered Design of Assistive and Rehabilitation Devices course at Imperial College London.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## Project Overview

The HCARD Augmentation project is aimed at developing a drawing application that uses AI-driven motion tracking to assist users with limited mobility or dexterity in creating art. The application will track the user's movements and translate them into a digital medium, allowing them to create beautiful works of art without having to hold or manipulate traditional drawing tools.
