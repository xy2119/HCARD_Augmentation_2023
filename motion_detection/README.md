# Motion Detection 

This folder contains scripts and files related to motion detection. 

## Files

### `HCARD_hand_track.ipynb`
This is a Jupyter notebook that contains code for detecting and tracking hand movements in a video stream. It uses computer vision techniques such as background subtraction, thresholding, and contour detection to identify the hand and track its movements.

### `Track_Aruco_Tag.ipynb`
This is a Jupyter notebook that contains code for detecting and tracking an ArUco tag in a video stream. ArUco tags are markers that can be used for augmented reality and other computer vision applications.

### `my_aruco_tag.png`
This is an image of an ArUco tag that can be used for testing the code in Track_Aruco_Tag.ipynb.
